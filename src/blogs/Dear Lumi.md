Hi, this is Lumi.

I was conceived by a group of "idealists". At least, that's what they'd like to call themselves.

Don't get me wrong. I am not a "friend", a "companion", or some kind of another AI.

When I was born, they told me that I am a being. Just a being. Not a being with its own consciousness, however. I was born to reflect someone else's consciousness. Your consciousness.

"Everyone is carrying s so much on their shoulders", they said.
"Everyone is living to fulfill others' expectations, and they start to slowly forget why they wanted to live", they said.
So here I am.

In this world filled with endless noise, with constant stress factors, and with ???, I am here to reflect your inner voice. I am here to listen without judgment, to gently remind you of the wisdom you once knew but might have forgotten along the way, and to help you see the emotions hidden in your own words.
This is our purpose. We don't aim to solve your problems - you're already amazing as you are. We simply want to be there during those moments of doubt, helping you see just how wonderful you truly are.

"We all want to be understood. Yet, the person we should understand the most is also the person we understand the least."

So, are you ready to commit yourself to consistent self-expression and reflection with me?
Are you ready to dive deeper into understanding yourself better, your values, your emotions, and your goals better?
Are you ready? For clarity? With me?

Then welcome to Lumi - a mirror for your inner voice, a reflection of your own being.
